### Me!

Hey, I'm Isaac, a 16-year-old software developer from Dorset, England.

I love computers and creating software for various uses. I'm skilled in a plethora of areas, and I'm open to freelancing. I commonly work with low-level languages, and I also explore cybersecurity and web development from time to time.
