### Me!

Hey, I'm Isaac, a 15 year old software developer from Dorset, England.
I've always been infatuated with computers, my greatest enjoyment is developing and building my own software for various purposes.

I have a wide skillset and am willing to do some freelancing. I *specialise* in - do the most of - software and game development, alongside many subjects in or related to cybersecurity.
