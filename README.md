### About me

I began programming when I was 9, and slowly gathered more and more knowledge on programming, GNU/Linux and computer systems as a whole.
I've always been infactuated with computers, my greatest enjoyment is developing and building my own software for various purposes. The majority of my programming skill has its roots in Python and C#, the first two languages I really attempted to master. Over time, I have slowly learned more languages as cases have arised where higher-level, slower languages just don't cut it.

> If I am ever inactive for extended durations, I am most likely going through exams.

*I use Artix btw.* <img src="https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/artix-icon-500x512-e5st20aa.png" alt="artix" width="25" height="25">
