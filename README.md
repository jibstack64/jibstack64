I would consider myself a software developer, but I do know my way around web development, I'm just not so fond of it.

I'm currently in the process of learning Rust, due to its apparent superiority to most other modern systems languages.

I have also dabbled in cybersecurity and crypto, although not in great depth.

### About me

I began programming when I was 9, and slowly gathered more and more knowledge on programming, GNU/Linux and computer systems as a whole.
I've always been infactuated with computers, my greatest enjoyment is developing and building my own software for various purposes.

The majority of my programming skill has its roots in Python, the first language I really attempted to master. Over time, I have slowly learned more languages as cases have arised where higher-level, slower languages just don't cut it.

*I use Artix btw.* <img src="https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/artix-icon-500x512-e5st20aa.png" alt="artix" width="25" height="25">

### Long time, no commit?

If I am ever inactive for extended durations, I am most likely going through exams, taking a break for festive events or have a lack of ideas.
