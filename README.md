#### Hey, I'm Isaac, a 15 year old experienced programmer.

I've been on the programming train since I was around 9, and have picked up Python, Go, Java, and C# (alongside a couple dozen other languages at a base-level).

#### Experience

I have the most experience with Python, but Go and C# come as a close second.
I started with C# (Unity), and worked my way up learning other languages.

#### My projects

You're going to see projects in or related to the image manipulation, cryptography, and penetration testing areas coming from me, but I will distribute my interest evenly.
