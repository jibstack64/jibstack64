### About me

I hopped on the programming train when I was around 9; after installing Ubuntu because I'd found that my newly bought laptop had a dysfunctional Windows install, I began learning and trying things out in Python. Later, in the first year of secondary schooling, I would go on to make a few Unity games, such as Tyler Tap: mediocre, but still a golden relic lost to my old OneDrive storage. Like most, I did not learn lower-level programming languages until now what is my late teens. C, C++ and any language lower than Python scared me up until the age of 12/13, where I finally decided it was time to learn a language with more control, which I decided Go was the perfect candidate for. Not too complex, Python-similar syntax and fast compile times. 

By this point, I was (predominantly) using Windows on all of my devices, leading me to the realisation that Linux may be the way to go if I wanted to continue learning programming - although not necessary, it was still of large benifit to my skillset, and would force me to fix issues head-on and develop my own tools. This is where I decided that it was time to learn C, C++ and try out some Java development; to my surprise, it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be, which is not surprising considering the experience I had accumulated in Python and Go by this point. This brings me to where I am now, 100s of projects lost to old, broken or reset drives and a new fondness towards the C and C++ languages (Holy C comes next).
