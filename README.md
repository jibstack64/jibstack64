Hey, I'm Isaac, a 15 year old software developer from Dorset, England.
I've always been infactuated with computers, my greatest enjoyment is developing and building my own software for various purposes.

The majority of my programming skill has its roots in Python, the first language I really attempted to master. Over time, I have slowly learned more languages as cases have arised where higher-level, slower languages just don't cut it.
