#### Hey, I'm Isaac, a 15 year old hermit (programmer).

I've been on the programming train since a young age and have picked up Python, C++, Java, Golang and Unity C# (alongside a half-dozen other languages at a base to somewhat intermediary understanding).

#### Experience

Python! I love Python, both for its simplicity and inviting community. I have the most experience in the language as it is the first one I started programming in! Despite this, I have developed a good amount of experience with Java, Golang, C++ and more.

#### My projects

You're going to see projects in or related to the image manipulation, game-modding and penetration testing areas, coupled with what you can only class as "random shit".
