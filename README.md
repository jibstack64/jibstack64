### Me!

Hey, I'm Isaac, a 16 year old software developer from Dorset, England.
I've always been infatuated with computers, my greatest enjoyment is developing and building my own software for various purposes.

I have a wide skillset and am willing to do some freelancing. I develop a lot of small-scale software using low-level languages, however I'll occasionally dabble in cybersecurity and web development.
